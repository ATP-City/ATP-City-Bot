        "value": "A new voice chat system has been set up! Below I will explain it briefly to you:\n\n**__Prerequistries__**\n- Have linked your Minecraft account with your Discord account, do so in the minecraft server with `/discord link`\n- Joined the #Lobby [JOIN HERE] channel in a game session\n\n**__How it works__**\nThe DiscordSRV plugins detects players in proximity of 100 blocks of one another, and groups them together into a voice channel. So for example if me and @Lemon#7174 and @Hiro#1462 are chilling at KFC and we all have joined the #Lobby [JOIN HERE] channel beforehand, we'll all be grouped to the same voice channel to speak to each other.\nAt the same time, let's say @Fondgazelle8357#6289 and @𝕮𝖑𝖆𝖞𝖙𝖔𝖓𝕱𝖑𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖗#1216 are on a highway ride next to one another, and they also have joined the #Lobby [JOIN HERE] channel, then they will be grouped to another voice channel together, different than mine.\nSo in this imaginary scenario a few voice channels have been created:\n- One that contains me, @Lemon#7174 and @Hiro#1462 \n- One that contains @Fondgazelle8357#6289 and @𝕮𝖑𝖆𝖞𝖙𝖔𝖓𝕱𝖑𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖗#1216 \nBasically, it's like talking in real life. You can't listen to one another when you're too far away!\nThis could potentially be useful when you are building together. The system can group you automatically.\n\n*The proximity bubble can be said to be a spheroid, with one semi-diameter (X, Z axes) being 100 blocks in length and another semi-diameter (Y axis) being 200 blocks in length.*\n*I hope you all enjoy this feature powered by DiscordSRV!*"
